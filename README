This README was written for the test submission to Dr. Lusth.

At the moment I do have the Grammar, Parser, and Recognizer finished. They should compile, and run with "make test"

I also have a "make clean that should clean any dependencies as well.

The environment folder has my current code in the environment. It is not compiling at the moment.
